    <div class="boxsm normal">This guy's kept his identity more secure than Spy, and while we don't know what goes on in that head of his, we can say for certain he isn't trying.

It will do continuous afterburn damage for a couple seconds after connecting which can be potent, but it's incredibly easy to damage multiple opponents at once. It's other function, airblast, can extinguish incendiary teammates, push opponents away, and reflect enemy projectiles to return to sender all manner of pipes, stickies and rockets.</div>
