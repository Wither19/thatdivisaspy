    <div class="boxsm normal">This lumbering trooper has the second highest health and the second slowest speed in the game. So it's a good thing that Soldier hardly navigates by ground. The focal point of Soldier's gameplay is rocket jumping. Blast off with the right precision, angling and timing to fly across maps. His rockets, in addition to the movement capabilities they hold, are one of the most massive sources of DPS in the game. He also has a shotgun. Fun fact: Soldier is an ordained priest!</div>
