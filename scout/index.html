    <br>
    <div class="boxsm normal">This fleet-of-foot Boston kid has excellent agility, a double jump, and remarkable DPS, which is counteracted by his low health pool. However, his mobility has the edge over that of other mercs, granting him swift passage through numerous flank routes. Effectively flanking your opponent to take them by surprise is the key to playing Scout, and laying the hurt on the poor sap you're bumrushing.</div>
