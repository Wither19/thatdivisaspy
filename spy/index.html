    <br>
    <div class="boxsm">Enter the furtive frenchman, the Spy. He is the epitome of stealth, to the point where one doubts his French nationality. He holds a revolver, which can provide good damage, given you have precision. He has a sapper to slowly, discreetly damage and destroy buildings. The most powerful weapon in his arsenal is his knife which can instantly kill with just the right positioning. His playstyle is one of the most demanding and intense in this game. Stealth is the name of the game, and every move of yours must be very deliberate while playing.</div>
